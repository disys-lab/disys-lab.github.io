Hello! My name is Kazi Arman. I am pursuing a Masters in Industrial Engineering from Oklahoma State University. I conduct research at the intersection of decentralized optimization, renewable-integrated chemical plant operations, and high-performance computing, where my work has achieved near-optimal control performance and enabled a 46% reduction in CO₂ emissions. In parallel, I’ve led data-driven healthcare research on Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) using Oracle Cerner Real-World Data from over 10 million patients, identifying key pre- and post-diagnosis comorbidity trajectories. I have co-authored a manuscript accepted at INFORMS ICSS 2025, presented my findings at academic symposiums, and developed robust preprocessing pipelines and trajectory-modeling workflows for large-scale clinical datasets.
