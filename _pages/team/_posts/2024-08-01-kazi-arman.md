Hello! My name is Kazi Arman Ahmed. I am pursuing a Masters in Industrial Engineering from Oklahoma State University. I conduct research at the intersection of decentralized optimization, renewable-integrated chemical plant operations, and high-performance computing. My current work extends this framework into a stochastic setting, where I am developing models that can capture uncertainty in renewable energy supply and plant operations while still delivering near-optimal control performance. In parallel, I've led data-driven healthcare research on Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) using Oracle Cerner Real-World Data from over 10 million patients, identifying key pre- and post-diagnosis comorbidity trajectories. I have co-authored a manuscript accepted at INFORMS Conference on Service Science 2025, presented my work at academic research symposiums and at the INFORMS Annual Meeting 2025, and also served as a session chair. In addition, I served as the Vice President of the OSU INFORMS Student Chapter and as the Graduate Representative for the Business Analytics Student Association.
