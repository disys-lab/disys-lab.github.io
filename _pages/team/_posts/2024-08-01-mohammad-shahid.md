My name is Mohammad Shahid Shaik, and I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a strong focus on advanced software engineering, optimization systems, and secure computational frameworks. My technical expertise spans Python, Streamlit, SQL, Docker, GCP, ONNX, and zero-knowledge proof systems, allowing me to build scalable, data-driven and cryptography-aware applications.

As a Graduate Research Assistant, I contribute to two major research initiatives: the Gustavo container-orchestration platform, where I design streamlined dashboards, backend services, and deployment workflows; and the Regulatory Hypothesis Tests (RHT) framework, where I develop zero-knowledge proof pipelines using Merkle trees, logistic regression, KS tests, and ONNX-based circuits. My work involves deep debugging, performance optimization, containerized microservices, and end-to-end proof generation.
