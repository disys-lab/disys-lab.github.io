I’m a Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. Paritosh Ramanan at Oklahoma State University. I am working on a project to develop an AI-agent orchestration framework using LangChain, MCP, and Gustavo. Previously, I worked under Dr. Sharmin Jahan, where I built a dataset from microservices traffic and developed machine learning models for anomaly detection, creating a self-protective service mesh that automatically handles attacks.

💼 With over 11 months of experience as a Junior Software Engineer at Tirzok Private Ltd., I am specialized in backend development. My work ranged from developing AI solutions and integrating AWS services to building backend systems using clients’ preferred frameworks and databases.
