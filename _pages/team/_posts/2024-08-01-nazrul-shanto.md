I’m a Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. Paritosh Ramanan at Oklahoma State University. I am working on a project to develop an AI-agent orchestration framework using LangChain, MCP, and Gustavo. Previously, I worked under Dr. Sharmin Jahan, where I built a dataset from microservices traffic and developed machine learning models for anomaly detection, creating a self-protective service mesh that automatically handles attacks.
