Hi, I’m Sathwik Yamana, a PhD student in Industrial Engineering at Oklahoma State University where I am working on deep state space models such as SpaceTime and their application to anomaly detection in Industrial Control Systems. I got a Masters in Computer Science with a strong focus on Python development, machine learning, and MLOps. My experience spans building agent-based models for energy forecasting, developing interactive Django applications, and working with OpenStudio and EnergyPlus for whole-building simulation. I’ve also worked on NLP research, where I engineered ETL pipelines and fine-tuned large language models like LLaMA-3, LongFormer, and RoBERTa to study model bias. With industry experience in data science and a growing set of certifications in DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps, I’m passionate about developing scalable, data-driven solutions and am actively open to Python Developer and ML roles.
