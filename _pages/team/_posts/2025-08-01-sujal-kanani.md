My name is Sujal Kanani, and I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am deeply interested in research and in exploring various fields by working on real-world problems.
Currently, I am working on a security and cryptography project that leverages the principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).
My research focuses on developing a system that enables statistical and analytical tests to be performed in zero knowledge.
In today’s environment, data is extremely valuable, and many organizations prefer to keep their datasets private. This often creates challenges for external parties who need to run hypothesis tests or validate results without direct access to the underlying data.
We are presenting an approach using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, where it becomes possible to run such tests without compromising privacy, without revealing any sensitive information, and while fully preserving the authenticity and correctness of the results. Our work aims to make secure, privacy-preserving data analysis possible on any private dataset.
