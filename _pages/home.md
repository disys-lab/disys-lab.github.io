### About the DISys Lab
The Distributed Intelligent Systems (DISys) Laboratory at Oklahoma State University is headed 
by Prof. Paritosh Ramanan, an Assistant Professor in the School of Industrial Engineering and Management. 
Our primary research objectives lie in exploring novel distributed algorithmic and computational frameworks to tackle efficiency, 
privacy, and security issues in large-scale industrial systems. Research at the lab consists of developing new distributed 
and decentralized methodologies focusing on optimization, machine learning and analytics. A significant part of our research also revolves
around scalability and implementation oriented design challenges that have led to open-sourced projects as well as patents.
Our research is being applied to alleviate critical gaps in exciting areas such as cybersecurity of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), 
chemical process decarbonization, energy systems, and neuromorphic computing. You can read more about our research here!

We currently have an amazing team of two doctoral, three masters and one undergrad student. We are always looking out for new members to join our group!
