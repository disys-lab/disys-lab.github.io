    Presentation on a zero-knowledge framework for cyberattack detection that enables
    regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure systems without exposing utility data.
  content: >
    Paritosh presented the DISys Lab’s latest work on zero-knowledge cyberattack detection
    for regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure systems at the IISE Annual
    Conference. The talk introduced a scalable detection framework that allows regulators
    to verify alarm correctness without gaining access to sensitive operational data from
    utilities.

    Building on residual-based statistical hypothesis testing for state-space models,
    the framework incorporates a two-pronged zero-knowledge architecture enforcing
    both temporal coherence of system dynamics and statistical consistency of detection
    tests. This design enables regulators to validate cyberattack alarms in a
    privacy-preserving manner, addressing one of the key barriers to modernizing
    compliance standards for industrial control systems.

    The approach demonstrates strong theoretical soundness and zero-knowledge guarantees,
    and its feasibility was validated using real-world datasets from critical
    infrastructure networks.

    Dr. Ramanan to serve as co-PI on new NSF grant from MSI program targeting privacy aware design in bio-manufacturing.
  content: >
    A new interdisciplinary research effort at Oklahoma State University is exploring
    how biofabrication facilities can collaboratively design personalized biomedical
    constructs while preserving data privacy. The work, supported by the National
    Science Foundation, focuses on enabling the secure exchange of design insights and
    manufacturing strategies between facilities—without revealing sensitive patient
    information or proprietary fabrication data.

    The project addresses a central challenge in personalized medicine: 3D-printing
    patient-specific tissues often requires extensive trial-and-error, but sharing
    such manufacturing knowledge between sites raises privacy and confidentiality
    concerns. The OSU team has developed a decentralized learning framework that
    incorporates differential-privacy protections to enable meaningful collaboration
    across institutions while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.

    The research team includes Professors Akash Deep, Srikanthan Ramesh, and
    Paritosh Ramanan, who together aim to advance secure biofabrication pipelines for
    next-generation personalized health care solutions. Their work highlights OSU’s
    growing leadership in digital manufacturing, biodesign, and privacy-preserving
    computational methods.

    DISys Lab is pleased to announce that the SplitVAEs paper has received the 2nd Runners Up in the Best Student
    Paper Award for its innovative contributions to decentralized scenario generation.
    SplitVAEs enables stakeholders to collaboratively train generative models without
    sharing raw data, addressing key challenges in data residency, privacy, and distributed
    modeling. The framework demonstrates how decentralized VAEs can generate high-quality,
    distribution-aligned scenarios suitable for robust stochastic optimization across
    industrial and energy domains. Congratulations to Lucius for this well-deserved
    recognition of his leadership and contributions.

    Two presentations on decentralized optimization for decarbonized chemical plants
    and decentralized importance sampling for scenario generation using VAEs.
  content: >
    DISys Lab members presented two research efforts centered on advancing
    decarbonization and data-driven planning for industrial and power system operations.

    The first talk, presented by Richard Reed, Saba Ghasemi, Paritosh Ramanan, and
    Zheyu Jiang, discussed decentralized operations planning for electrified chemical
    plants integrated with renewable-driven transmission systems. The team presented a
    decentralized mixed-integer optimization strategy using iterative ADMM along with a
    relaxation-to-integer transition to achieve consensus across stakeholders. Their
    results demonstrated that decentralized unit commitment and process heating operations
    can meet demand while preserving stakeholder privacy and maintaining performance
    comparable to centralized benchmarks.

    The second presentation, delivered by Huynh Quang Nguyen Vo, Richard Reed,
    Saba Ghasemi Naraghi, and Zheyu Jiang, explored decentralized importance sampling
    using variational autoencoders to generate high-fidelity industrial carbon emissions
    scenarios. Leveraging decentralized VAE-based methods, the team demonstrated how
    generated scenarios capture spatiotemporal interdependencies across multiple chemical
    plants while respecting privacy constraints inherent to siloed datasets. These
    scenarios, supported by importance weighting, were shown to improve stochastic
    optimization workflows for planning decarbonized industrial and power system
    operations.

    Both the Identify–Build–Demonstrate (IBD) and Find the Flag (FTF) challenges are live,
    inviting students to showcase their skills in decentralized systems and industrial cybersecurity.

    The IBD Challenge encourages participants to design and build decentralized applications using
    technologies such as Ethereum and IPFS for industrial use cases including anomaly detection,
    energy trading, and decentralized auctions. Teams will present a poster and working prototype
    at the IEM Research Symposium on April 17th.

    The Find the Flag Challenge tasks teams with uncovering vulnerabilities in a hosted
    critical-infrastructure-inspired IT system. Participants gain hands-on experience with
    security audits, REST API concepts, authentication mechanisms, and cyber-hygiene practices
    for protecting industrial control systems.

    Registration opened on March 12th, with tutorials released on March 19th. The submission
    window opens April 7th, the FTF challenge releases April 9th, and all final submissions are
    due April 16th. Winners will be announced at the IEM Awards Banquet on April 18th.

    Prizes totaling $1400 are available across both competitions, with awards for winners
    and runners-up in the IBD and FTF categories. Tutorials and resources covering blockchain,
    cybersecurity fundamentals, and relevant Python tools are provided to support participants.
    For questions, participants may contact the organizing team at incyse-hackathon@okstate.edu.
